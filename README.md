This repo contains the work of an auto-fix script desgined to target Debian/Ubuntu based distros
To be able to run the script


Run the 'run_update.sh' and it'll do all the heavy lifting of cloning the repo
Change access permissions to the script
Placing the script in the bin
And keep only the relevant things by removing everything unnecessary including the 'run_update.sh'
